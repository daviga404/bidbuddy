## What is BidBuddy?<a id="what-is-bidbuddy"></a>
Are you tired of loading up eBay, typing in your query, selecting "Auction", and organizing by "Time: Ending Soonest"?<br/>
**BidBuddy** is a Chrome Extension to make life just a little easier! Instead of navigating to eBay all the time to find any new listings that could be a steal, you can simply click a button and BidBuddy will do the rest.

## Requirements<a id="requirements"></a>

 * [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome)
 * [An eBay Developer Account](http://developer.ebay.com)

## Installation<a id="installation"></a>

 1. Download BidBuddy.crx from the [Releases page](releases).
 2. Open Google Chrome
 3. Go to Tools > Extensions, or enter `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
 4. Drag BidBuddy.crx onto the page and install the extension!
 
## Usage<a id="usage"></a>
BidBuddy is incredibly easy to use! Simply enter your search query into the search box and click "Save", then enter one or more\* exclusions into the exclusions box et voila! The results should load, but it may take time to get the data. If no results load, click the BidBuddy button again to re-open the dialog.

## Pull Requests<a id="pull-requests"></a>
I am open to any pull requests! Please submit them for review, and if you're lucky, I might just accept it ;)

### Notes

\* Currently, BidBuddy **requires** at least one exclusion. This may be patched in future commits.
